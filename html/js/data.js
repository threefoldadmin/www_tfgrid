In 2018 we established Green Edge Cloud as an early ThreeFold 'Farmer' and we now have computers connected to the ThreeFold Grid in 6 countries. We are excited by the possibility of both benefitting our World and building a profitable and sustainable business for our stakeholders",

        "description": "You don't often get the chance to be involved early in a new technology which has truly global potential, and ThreeFold's innovative reimagining of how standard storage and compute servers can be utilised may well shake up the cloud computing world. ThreeFold is building its technology and business around a core of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), a rare thing in an industry dominated by big corporates. Dragon Edge Cloud intends to expand the ThreeFold Grid across the APAC region, supplying decentralised autonomous internet capacity directly to end users and allowing them to be in complete control over the data that is rightfully theirs.",

From advocating human rights of political prisoners in East Berlin - to my mission at an international development bank of transforming society with small and big projects - to running an educational social enterprise/charity for disadvantaged children and their parents, I always strived to combine my professional work with a tangible, positive societal impact. And all the pieces of the puzzle fell harmoniously together when my journey finally led me to ThreeFold. A common, unique opportunity to transform our communities and our digital life for the better – with equality, freedom, privacy and sustainability as our core inspiration. The beginning of a new journey for each and every one of us…",

Starting as a farmer was very easy even for a non Techie (I’m a VP of HR in the corporate world) and I’m proud to be part of this community of wonderful people that all have the same mindset, good hearts and the will to make this world a better place. Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. – Margaret Mead",
